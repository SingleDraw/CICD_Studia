You **should not** attach things like `AdministratorAccess` or `AdministratorAccess-AWSElasticBeanstalk` to EC2 instances.  
(It's **WAY too much permission** just for an app server â€” huge security risk.)

---

# ðŸ”¥ Here's **what you should check when creating the EC2 instance profile**:

| Step | What to check |
|:-----|:--------------|
| 1 | Create a **new IAM Role** for EC2 (trusted entity = EC2) |
| 2 | **Attach right policies** for Elastic Beanstalk EC2 instances |
| 3 | Policy should allow the instance to: |
| | - Write logs to **CloudWatch** |
| | - Access **S3 buckets** (for app deploy/download) |
| | - (optional) Access secrets or database (if needed for your app) |
| 4 | Minimal permissions = safer and more professional |
| 5 | Save the role, and it becomes an **instance profile** automatically |

---

# ðŸ“‹ **Minimal policies you need**

Hereâ€™s what normally you want to attach:

- **AWS managed policies:**
  - `AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier`
  - `AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier`
  - `AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker`
  - `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy`
  - `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` (optional if you download from S3)

âœ… **These are AWS-managed safe policies**, scoped to what EC2 needs.

âœ… After you attach these, your instance profile will be ready.

---

# âœ¨ If you want to be **even more minimal and custom** (optional advanced):

I can also show you a **custom minimal inline policy** that only gives access to:

- `/aws/elasticbeanstalk/*` S3 objects
- Logs to `/aws/elasticbeanstalk/*` log groups

(Much more secure than full `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`.)

If you want, say the word and Iâ€™ll paste it ready for you. ðŸš€

Would you like me to show a full ready **IAM Role Create** screen example too? (so you can click-click quickly)? ðŸ”¥  
It would take 1 minute to set it up after that! ðŸš€
